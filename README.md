# About the project
This is a simple pixel art styel card game coded in python.
The sources are founded with patience and hardworking for accurate vibe and theme
AND NOW YOU CAN IMPROVE THE CODE IN THE ROUTE YOU WANT TO :)

# Source code and EXE version
This project is both in exe installer version(source code included in the projects file) for previewing how it looks like and another  OPTION  source code ITSELF.

# IMPORTANT
-FOR THE SOURCE CODE YOU HAVE TO PUT THE PY CODE IN THE MAIN FOLDER(OUT OF THE SOURCE CODE FOLDER, put it BETWEEN SOURCES )IN EXE VERSION !!!
OR PUT THE SOURCES WITH PY CODE IN ANOTHER FOLDER YOU WANT TO FOR CLEANER SPACE TO WORK ON
-SAME FOR THE SOURCE CODE ITSELF TOO BECAUSE IN CODES THE PATHS ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE ROOT THEY ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE SOURCES

# Warning
the sources that are used in the game are a bit shuffled next time and next projects i will make them tidier

# Required libraries
-tkinter
-random
-pillow
-pygame
